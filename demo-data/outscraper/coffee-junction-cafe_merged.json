The waitress seated us and proceeded to disappear without even taking our order. we had to flag down other waiters to take our orders. They brought incomplete cutlery. We constantly had to ask for basic things, cutlery, serviettes, condiments, etc.\nThe (presumably) manager (white male) was so rude \ud83e\udee8. We were speaking to the waitress about our order, he just walked up to our table and began scolding her in front of us, which was very degrading for her, but he didn\u2019t even bother to greet or acknowledge us or the fact that the waitress was in the middle of a conversation already.

Despite ongoing training, there are unfortunately instances where some of our staff overlook basic service steps, such as ensuring cutlery is placed before meals are served. This lapse directly impacts our guests\u2019 experience, and I regret that it affected yours.\nIf I came across as \u201crude\u201d, please know it stemmed from frustration with the situation and the failure on our part to deliver the quality you deserve. I will personally investigate the matter, review the relevant camera footage, and take corrective steps to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\nYour input means a great deal to us \u2014it helps us and reinforces our commitment to accountability.

They bring food without cutlery, they forget orders, fail to check in during the meal. This has been the case for months now. When you take it up with the manager, he is quick to apologise and offer vouchers for free meals, but we don\u2019t go there for free meals\u2026 its the general operation of the establishment that needs attention. If you want to go for a quick meal, rather find another place, as this establishment doesn\u2019t mind to have you wait for coffee and a piece of toast.",

Unfortunately, we've experienced a significant staff turnover due to the inability of our long-standing Zimbabwean employees to renew their visas.\nThese team members were highly capable and had been with us for many years. We've since hired new South African staff and are investing in extensive training to restore our service standards.\nAlthough we understand that you didn't visit our shop for a free meal, we offered you vouchers as a gesture of goodwill and a sincere apology for your poor service experience. We hope this will demonstrate our commitment to making things right.\nWe value your feedback and would be delighted to have you visit us again, giving us the opportunity to show you our improved service. Your continued feedback is welcome, and we appreciate the time you've taken to share your concerns.\nThank you for your understanding. Duncan ",
